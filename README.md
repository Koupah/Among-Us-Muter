# Among-Us-Editor

## Description ##  
A really, **really** simple, java 7 compliant, discord bot that mutes people in a "Among Us" voice channel when you press the '=' key (default).  
You need to put in your own bot token and guild ID then run it on your computer.  
Should be a simple press of a key to mute/unmute everyone.
